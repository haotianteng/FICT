## FICT - FISH Iterative Cell Typing  
## Is a software for achieve accurate cell typing by iteratively incorporating neighbourhood information using Expectation-Maximization algorithm, for Fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) technique.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haotianteng/FICT.git
cd FICT
python install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Prepare dataset for running
Currently different FISH project using different data format, so 4 scripts are provided for dataset preparation for different datasets in FICT-SAMPLE tutorial repository.  

### Sample code
Please check [FICT-SAMPLE](https://github.com/haotianteng/FICT-SAMPLE) for sample code to run FICT.
